                                        Hades, in Greek mythology, is the god of the underworld, ruling over the realm of the dead. 
                                        As one of the major Olympian gods, his domain is distinct from the realms of his brothers 
                                        Zeus and Poseidon, governing the afterlife and the souls of the deceased. Hades is often 
                                        depicted as a stern and somber figure, residing in the depths of the underworld alongside 
                                        his queen, Persephone.

                                        deeds in life. While Hades is not typically portrayed as actively participating 
                                        in the affairs of the living or the other gods, he is a pivotal figure in Greek

                                        among the gods and between gods and mortals. Despite his bravery, he's often depicted
